# MasterDev_ClientTemplate
This code requires a web service to work.  Create a web service that returns a string policy number and you'll be off and running!

There are 4 examples of different styles of loading a list of policy numbers in a grid:
  sync,
  async,
  async parallel programming, and
  an advanced async parallel programming technique
  
  examples show times that web service calls took and total times for all policies to be returned and written to the grid.
